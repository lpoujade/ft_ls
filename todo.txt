- Recursive list folders/subfolders :
	- loop while folder in last list
	- transmit (return value?) state : if folder in last list or not
	- each folder-node has an attached list
- Segf on error : save error in struct OR notice node as void
- init fields sizes to 10
- reverse sorting option : - transmit boolean to compare function
						   - to list function
